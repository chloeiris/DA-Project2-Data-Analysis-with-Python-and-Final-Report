# DA-Project2-Data-Analysis-with-Python-and-Final-Report

Hello!

In this repo you will find all the docs for a Data Analysis Project done with Python. 
Given our client's data, we were asked to extract an analysis of what we considered most interesting for the company.
So, we focused on answering a business expansion question: Should Adalab (our client) launch a new Bootcamp on Machine Learning?

For this, the steps we followed were:
1. Converting all files to csv and unifying them into a single and complete file. (Data size allowed this step)
2. Deciding which were the in-detail questions we were going to answer with the data.
3. Selecting the relevant variables and merging them into a new dataset.
4. Cleaning the selected data to be able to draw conclusions.
5. Making the graphs to explain the analysis.
6. Writing a report with our conclusions.

For this we used the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sidetable
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
- Mysql.connector
- Requests
- Ast

The final result is a REPORT with all the graphs and conclusions on whether launching a new bootcamp is a good business next step for our client.
